`Batch.dart` is:

### 1.1.1. **_Optimized for job scheduling_** üöÄ

It was designed and implemented to enable the robust and fast continuous batch processing required by modern systems.

### 1.1.2. **_Productive_** üë®‚Äçüíª

Do you think scheduling jobs is a difficult and arduous task? With `Batch.dart` you no longer need such complex definitions and can focus on more productive tasks.

`Batch.dart` wraps as much of the complexity and definitions required for `job scheduling` as possible, making it extremely easy and intuitive to do so. It is also designed to use as little as possible of the complex configuration files often found when launching programs in frameworks and to switch between them during program execution as needed.

### 1.1.3. **_Runs on Dart VM_** üèÑ

Since `Batch.dart` runs on the `Dart VM`, the greatest benefit will be the ability to create batch applications using the excellent open sources of `Dart` community.
